## About Me
I am a Machine Learning Research Engineer with a strong background in applied research, focusing on the development of privacy-preserving algorithms in data processing and analysis. My career is driven by a passion for innovation in machine learning and data security, seeking to build solutions that protect user privacy while enhancing model performance.

## Experience

### Applied Research Engineer | TripleBlind Inc, Kansas City, MO
*Jun 2022 â€” Present*
- Implemented a privacy-preserving loss function using the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), enhancing model security against inversion and membership attacks.
- Advanced model performance through innovative techniques such as MixUp, Intra-instahide, and Gradprune, focusing on boosting defense mechanisms and convergence efficiency.
- Developed a modular framework with leakage metrics for evaluating model defenses before deployment against inversion attacks
- Created a new strategy for varying learning rate between rounds and epochs with implementing custom cyclic learning rate schedulers for
distributed learning
- Transformed the training protocol by implementing split inference, eliminating the need to send the server model to clients for evaluation.
Developed a distributed evaluation process, optimizing efficiency and data privacy while aligning with industry standards
